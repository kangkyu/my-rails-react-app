Q. I found how to bower on Rails [here](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/5-ways-to-manage-front-end-assets-in-rails) and [here](https://coderwall.com/p/hhaxlg/bower-and-rails-friends-forever). By the way How do you have `npm install` or `package.json` file in Rails?

I'm currently working on those two questions. Help me have answer, I'll appreciate. :smiley:
